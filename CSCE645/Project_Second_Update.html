<u>Title</u>: Sweep volume generation of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle with dynamic geometry.<br/>
<u>Name</u>: Pradeep Garigipati<br/>

<ul>
<li><p><u>Summary of Work to Date</u>:</p><p> Programming issues stated in the previous update related to normal vector computation have been resolved. The second goal of producing the swept volume of given object has not been achieved yet.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Analysis of Work</u>:</p><p>The first goal among the updated goal list of previous update have been achieved. Object visibility has been corrected which had issues earlier due to normal vector computation errors. Currently I am trying to implement the technique mentioned in the paper "On swept volume formulations: implicit surfaces" by Abdel-Malek K et.al. March-2000. Understanding the mathematics behind the papers mentioned in Project proposal consumed more amount of the time for me. Currently I am formulating the portion of code which is required for implementing the technique in the above mentioned paper. Hence, the planned second goal is not achieved yet. <br/></p></li>

<li><p><u>Plan for Completion</u>:</p> Updated Goals:
<ul><li> Complete the pending second goal. </li>
<li> Complete the next goal of generating the sweep volume of the object considering that the geometry of the object is changing while it is moving along a given path. </li></ul></li>
