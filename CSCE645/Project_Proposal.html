<u>Title</u>: Sweep volume generation of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle with dynamic geometry.<br/>
<u>Name</u>: Pradeep Garigipati<br/>
<br/>
<u>Summary</u>:

<ul>
<li><p><u>Description of Problem</u>:- Generating the sweep volume of an Unmanned Ground vehicle(hereafter referred to as UGV) robot for  a given path, considering the change in geometry of the UGV during motion.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Importance of Problem</u>: During the design stage of robots, significant amount of effort goes into planning a obstacle free motion. This is related to collision detection between the robot and other geometrical objects which it encounters in the environment. In such cases, efficient way of detecting the collision is to find the swept volume of the robot(with dynamic geometry; due to articulation of some of the  parts of the robot) and find if it is intersecting the geometry of the obstacle during its motion. Once we generate the new surface/envelope which describes the swept volume of the object in particular motion, in a single attempt we can identify if there is a collision with any obstacle and if yes, where. Having identified if a course is collision free, now the robot can decide if to take it or not. In case there are no other paths, it can try to adjust its geometry(since few parts of the robot can articulate) and retry the whole process to check if this could avoid collision now.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Previous Work on Problem</u>:</p><ul><li>Martin, R R et.al. (1990) worked on designing a new algorithm to generate swept volumes of a solid body using envelope theory from differential geometry.</li><li>Abdel-Malek K et.al. (2000), worked on representing swept volume of implicit surfaces using Jacobian rank deficiency condition.</li></ul></li>

<li><p><u>Proposal</u>: Assuming that the approximate shape of any UGV can be represented in terms of few basic geometric objects such as spheres,cylinders etc, we model the robot  using these basic blocks. All the basic blocks are represented using implicit functions with reference to the robot. Once we have complete model for the robot, we choose a desired path in virtually created arena and generate a Sweep volume for the objects motion in given path.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Originality</u>: Many variants of the problem described have been worked on earlier. I intend to apply these techniques in conjunction with few hueristics(approximation of object geometry in terms of much simpler shapes like spheres, cylinders etc.) which might help generate much simpler sweep volume for complex objects(with respect to robotics).</p></li>

<li><p><u>Relationship to Geometric Modeling (optional)</u>: </p></li>

<li><p><u>List of Goals</u>: Points 1,2 and 3 are the first,second and final update goals respectively.
